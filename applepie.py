Jordan and I are baking apple pies. You will be given the number of pies I am baking.
The amount of fat (grams) I gain is 2x the calories I eat, where x is the number of calories eaten.
Each pie is 20 calories (and I eat all the pies I make!)
Calculate and return how much fat I gained on Thanksgiving.

Input: number of pies I will bake (int). Can be any integer from [0, 15]
Return: TOTAL amount of fat gained (int)

Test Cases:
Input: 5    Output: 200
Input: 1    Output: 40
